## Overview 

On any given night, nearly 60,000 [1] people experience homelessness in Los Angeles County, and an estimated 141,000 [2] are homeless in any given year. In response to this growing crisis, voters in Los Angeles County passed Measure H, agreeing to increase their taxes to add an estimated $355 million in homeless services each year.

In response to this need, the California Policy Lab has been working in close collaboration with the LA County Homeless Initiative and LA County Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to on various projects around homelessness, such as predicting homelessness among single adults receiving mainstream County services. The purpose of this work is to help identify people at high risk of homelessness and then get an undestanding of risk factors to design and test homelessness prevention strategies. 

### Projects

The pathways into homelessness are dynamic and complicated, as are the pathways to receiving county resources in LA County. Figure 1 displays a generalized overview of the homeless system flow. Individuals in LA County who are at risk of homelessness or are homeless interact with the county system (i.e. by utilizing a public hospital, or even, for instance, by interacting with a stree outreach team). Some of these individuals are assessed to determine their risk and then get allocated potential resources such as food stamps, entrance into job training programs or even housing.

**Figure 1.** depics a crude graph of the homeless system flow. (1) The HL Universe includes all individuals in LA who are at risk of homelessness or already homeless. (2) Some of these individuals interact with county agencies, such as the Department of Health Services or the Coordinated Entry System. (3) A subset of those individuals receive assessments such as the Vulnerability Index – Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Prescreen Tool (VI-SPDAT), the results of which are then used to (4) receiving assistance, such as permanent housing. 

The California Policy Lab is working on project at each of these system flow points:
1. Predicting and Preventing Homelessness: The aim of this project is to identify individuals who are at risk of becoming homelessness and intervene before these individuals end up on the streets. By leveraging linked data from county agencies and applying machine learning models, we are hoping to predict homelessness amongst different populations, such as single adults as well as families, and intervene. 
2. Evaluating Assessment Tool: Several surveys, such as the Vulnerability Index – Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Prescreen Tool (VI-SPDAT) or the Prevention Targeting Tool (PTT) are utilized in LA County to allocate resources to vulnerable populations. In this project, we evaluate the efficacy of these tools, while also improving the tool's predictive abilities. 
3. Evaluating Homeless Prevention Measures in LA: This project focuses on evaluating Los Angeles Homelessness Prevention Strategies A1 (focused on families) and A5 (focused on single adults and transition-aged youth). The evaluation focused on who was being served and how; if there were ways to improve the services; and whether prevention programs are reducing inflows to homelessness.

General Relief (GR) recipients. Note that while individuals who are homeless in the HMIS are required to meet the HUD definition of homelessness, this is not
a requirement to be flagged as homeless in the GR data.
