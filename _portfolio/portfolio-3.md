## Overview 

With researchers at the NARA Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Japan, I am developing a new research plan to study abusive language and gatekeeping in Twitch streams.
In the fall of 2021, we were awarded the SICSS grant to pursue this research. 

## Abstract

This research plans to investigates how Twitch streaming contexts modulate participants’ use of abusive language, with emphasis on community gatekeeping. 
We look at three levels of context—platform, genre, and user—by examining changes in users’ language as they move across genres in the platform. 
In so doing, we ask (1) what does abusive gatekeeping look like on an online platform like Twitch that affords little opportunity for one-to-one communication, 
(2) how do users in various genres leverage abusive language to collaborate and compete as they shape their discourse communities, (3) are individuals’ abusive language behaviors affected
by code-switching across genres, and (4) to what extent does language change involve a shift in the way abusive language is used, 
rather than an increase/decrease in abusive language itself? These questions are both broad and complex, in that general trends and patterns of 
Twitch users are interpreted in light of underlying motivations across context. As such, we utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining digital trace data 
(preliminary N = 27840964 chat logs from Twitch streams) with computational network analysis with qualitative methods such as ethnographic mapping and discourse 
elicitation, from surveys and interviews with Twitch users (expected survey N = 500; interview N = 55)
