I am a Research Data Analyst at the California Policy Lab, working on issues related to homelessness in Los Angeles County. Our projects include building predictive models to predict and prevent homelessness among single adults, families and youth as well as validating tools such as the Prevention Targeting Tool and the CES Triage Tool used for resource allocation by county agencies.  

Broadly, I am interested in applying computational and data science methods to the social sciences and approaches to ethics. As no computational method exists in a vaccum of scientific objectivity, it's important to think through the implications of how research might impacts different communities.

# What's New?

I am planning on applying to PhD programs this 2021 cycle. Wish me luck!
